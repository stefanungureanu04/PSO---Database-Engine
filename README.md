This repository focuses on the development of a database management system built using a clientâ€“server model designed to handle multiple simultaneous connections.

The application allows users to manage databases through a custom query interface, providing structured operations for data creation, manipulation, and persistence.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
__________________________

* Server Component:
  Handles client requests, manages database operations, and ensures concurrent access through socket-based communication.

* Client Component:
  Acts as a command-line interface for users to connect to the server, execute queries, and visualize results.

__________________________
The application is implemented with full support for Linux distributions and is designed as a command-line utility, allowing lightweight execution and easy integration into development environments or scripts.

KEY FEATURES:
__________________________
* Multi-client connection handling
* Persistent storage of database files
* Custom command parsing and execution
* Secure and efficient socket communication
* Modular architecture for scalability
